  * Pick up a card either from the deck or the bazaar, it is not possible to pick up the card which the player just sold.
  * Play one of the cards in hand or sell it back to the bazaar.

== Cards ==

There are three types of cards in the game:
  * *Wall*, this is the most basic card, it allows the player to place a wall anywhere on an open intersection of the board. Note that walls are shared by all players, and it is possible to help another player complete their territory by placing a wall.
  * *Expand*, this card allows the player to expand a completed territory, it is possible to expand into unclaimed area, or any opposing territory which contains less knights than the expanding territory.
  * *Knight*, this card provides defense from opposing players who may wish to expand into your territory. As long as your territory contains equal or greater number of knights than any adjacent territory the opposing player will not be able to expand into it.
